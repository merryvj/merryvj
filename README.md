## Yay it works! ヽ(≧◡≦)八(o^ ^o)ノ

Hi, I'm Mary! I've designed and prototyped novel search UIs, AR map apps, and generative new media projects. I recently graduated (May 2023) from Duke University with a B.A. in Computer Science. 

Currently, I'm interested in making tools for personal computing and visualizing information. My github is a collection of learning projects – a bit haphahazard, but all for the sake of joy and curiosity.
